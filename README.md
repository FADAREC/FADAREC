# 🌟 Fadare Caleb Tomiwa's Tech Stack and Interests  

Hey there! 👋 I'm Caleb, a tech enthusiast who loves building, breaking (sometimes on purpose), and fixing things 🔧💻. I specialize in turning caffeine ☕ and creativity 🎨 into functional, efficient code. When I'm not coding, I'm probably imagining a world where every bug fixes itself.

## 🛠 Primary Tech Stack  

### Programming Languages  
- 🐍 **Python** – My first love. Clean, elegant, and occasionally magical.  
- 🐘 **PHP** – Because backend devs deserve some love too.  
- 🖥️ **C** – The OG powerhouse—manual memory management? Bring it on!   

### Backend Development  
- 🚀 **Laravel** – Why reinvent the wheel when it’s already turbocharged?  
- 🌟 **Lumen** – Laravel’s lightweight sibling for when I’m feeling minimalistic.  
- 🍰 **Flask** – Quick and easy, like your favorite snack.  
- ⚡ **Node.js** – Non-blocking like a true multitasker.  
- 🐍 **Django** - You have a deadline in 24 hrs innit?? This guy can help with the backend thingy--Just to some point tho :)

### Frontend Development  
- 🏗 **HTML5** – Where every great app begins.  
- 🎨 **CSS3** – Turning “meh” designs into masterpieces.  
- ⚛ **React** – Because dynamic UIs are fun (until they aren’t).  

### Databases  
- 🏠 **MySQL** – The reliable classic.  
- 💼 **MSSQL** – Enterprise-approved and ready to work.  
- 📜 **SQLite** – Lightweight and perfect for smaller projects.  

### Cloud Hosting

## ⚡ Areas of Interest  

### 🌟 **Automating Development Workflows** 🤖  
Who has time for repetitive tasks? Not me tho. I build tools and scripts to make life fun (and much more easier).  

### 🌟 **Innovative Application Development** 💡  
Creating apps that don’t just look good—they actually solve problems. Functional *and* fancy? Yes, please!  

### 🌟 **API Development** 🔌  
Designing APIs so smooth, you’ll think they were made of butter. 🧈  

### 🌟 **Mentorship** 🎓  
Teaching and guiding others to explore the wild world of tech. Bonus: they sometimes teach me things too (humbling moments included).  

### 🌟 **Cybersecurity Exploration** 🛡️  
Currently dabbling in the cybersecurity universe. Not breaking into systems... just *gently* poking around. 😏  

### 🌟 **System Optimization** ⚙️  
Why settle for "it works" when you can make it work *better*? I’ll spend hours optimizing code to save milliseconds. It’s a lifestyle.
